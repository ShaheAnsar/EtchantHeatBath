See title. Requires a m168 powered mini pro (Any m168p board should be fine tho)  

### BOM
1. Arduino Mini Pro (Atmega168)
2. 40W ceramic heating cartridge (These are also used for 3D printers)
3. Some kind of logic level MOSFET that can handle about 3.3A of current
4. A 12V supply for the heater
5. A thermocouple and a MAX6675 board
6. A 4 digit clock display that uses a TM1637
