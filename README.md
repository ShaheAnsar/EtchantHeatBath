# EtchantHeatBath
See title. Requires a m168 powered mini pro (Any m168p board should be fine tho)  

### BOM
1. Arduino Mini Pro (Atmega168)
2. A mains powered water heater. Make sure that the leads are isolated from
mains, otherwise you could be in for a nasty surprise, assuming you live through it.
I've honestly just ordered one so got no clue if they are isolated or not. I'll
update when I receive it.
3. An SSR, should be rated for the voltage and current for the heater you buy
5. A thermocouple and a MAX6675 board
6. A 4 digit clock display that uses a TM1637 (Mine died so I'll replace the code for this with that
of a 1602)
7. A few push buttons and resistors
8. A UART to USB converter
